# Timestamp Saver Application

This is a simple Express.js application that saves the current timestamp to a text file and retrieves all saved timestamps.

## Features

- **Save Current Timestamp**: 
  - The application creates a text file with the current timestamp in the `Current_TimeStamp` folder each time the root endpoint `https://nodejstask-1-4a5h.onrender.com/` is accessed.
  - The timestamp is formatted as `dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm-ss`.
  - The response includes a message confirming that the timestamp was saved.

- **Retrieve All Timestamps**:
  - The `https://nodejstask-1-4a5h.onrender.com/getTextFiles` endpoint lists all the `.txt` files in the `Current_TimeStamp` folder, which represent saved timestamps.
